<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="What is VOEIS?" selected="selected" style="height: 100px; width: auto;"><span>The Virtual Observatory and Ecological Informatics System (VOEIS) is an end-to-end management solution for a wide variety of environmental data types. VOEIS provides a framework for data acquisition, quality assurance/control, visualization, and provenance tracking of temporally and spatially located data.</span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Who are the target users?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>VOEIS was designed to meet the data control, curation, sharing and publication needs typical to research scientists working in the earth sciences. However, the flexible data model makes the software appealing to a very broad set of use cases and is in no way limited to use by researchers only.</span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Who owns VOEIS?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>VOEIS was developed with funding from the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s (NSF) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a capacity building program to enhance researchers&rsquo; and institutions&rsquo; ability to compete for federal research funds. This project is supported jointly by funding from EPSCoR programs in Montana and Kentucky. Currently, the Data Hub is hosted on a server at Montana State University. However, the software stack is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/yogo/VOEIS#readme" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="How much does it cost to use?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>If you work within the Montana University system, the Data Hub is free to use. Just contact the system administrator to set up an account and start managing your data!</span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Is VOEIS ready to use now?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>VOEIS is currently used by numerous research groups within the Montana University system as a fully functional data management system. New features are being added all the time and the final version of the VOEIS software stack is expected in August of 2012.</span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="How do I create an account?" style="width: auto; height: auto;"><span>If you would like to create and account and begin storing data in VOEIS, contact the Research Computing Group at Montana State University:<a href="http://rcg.montana.edu/contact/" target="_blank">  http://rcg.montana.edu/contact/</a></span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="How much data can I store in VOEIS?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>Lots! Typical users of VOEIS will never need to worry about the amount of space available for their data. If your research group regularly produces gigabytes or terabytes of data that needs to be stored and managed, it is probably worth engaging in a quick discussion with the system administrator prior to loading data. Currently, the system is administered by the Research Computing Group at Montana State University:<a href="http://rcg.montana.edu/contact/" target="_blank">  http://rcg.montana.edu/contact/</a></span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Do I need special training?" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><span>We hope not. There are video tutorials and traditional text tutorials with screen-shots available to help guide you through use of VOEIS. We attempted to make the user interfaces intuitive and simple to facilitate ease-of-use. If you do find yourself in need of more explanation, contact the system administrator.</span></div>
<div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Can I have my own version of the software?"><span>Yes! VOEIS is available under the MIT open source license and is freely available to anyone interested in the source code. Feel free to install a version of the software on your own server, or customize the source code so that it suites your specific use-case needs. The most recent version of the VOEIS software is posted on <a href="https://github.com/yogo/VOEIS#readme" target="_blank"> GitHub.</a></span></div>
