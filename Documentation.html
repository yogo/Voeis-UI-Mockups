  VOEIS is a YOGO Data Management Framework (YDMF) application. The YOGO framework is a 
set of software tools developed at Montana State University for rapid assembly of data 
management applications. The framework is database agnostic, and supports data versioning 
and evolving schemas. As an added bonus, it's completely open source! Users interested in 
learning more should check out the YOGO website:

  The Virtual Observatory and Ecological Informatics System (VOEIS) provides a framework for data 
acquisition, analysis, model integration, and display of data products from completed workflows 
including geo-spatially explicit models, graphs from statistical analyses, GIS displays of classified 
ecological attributes on the landscape, and 3-D visualization models of waterscape and landscape 
processes. VOEIS is a an operating system independent web application built with 
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> on a 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> backend. At the core of the 
VOEIS is the VOEIS Data Hub, an application to enable coherent data management for data collected 
from streaming sensor networks, generated from laboratory experiments on samples taken in the field, 
and recorded from direct field observations. The VOEIS Data Hub is implemented using the YDMF, which 
contributes significantly to the software in three specific ways: 1) rigorous authentication and 
authorization requirements, 2) static data model support, and 3) import and export of data to external 
data sources.

<b>Vision: </b> To develop and deploy an integrated sensor based ecological informatics system 
through extensive collaborative research efforts between a consortium of academic entities in the 
states of Montana and Kentucky. An integral part of our vision is understanding the greater concepts 
and processes that govern the underlying informatics infrastructure and software.
<br></br>
<h3>Important Guiding Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data is a collection of typed values and associated meta-data</li>
<li>Data is organized according to a schema which determines relationships and multiplicities.</li>
<li>Raw data may come in many formats depending on the sensor equipment that is used.</li>
<li>Raw data can be parsed in order to get it into some format that implements a schema. Depending on the schema, loss of fidelity and semantics is possible.</li>
<li>After parsing, data and its associated meta-data becomes part of the main trunk.</li>
<li>A user can then work in a private sandbox. A private sandbox is in essence a branch of the main trunk with a private copy of the data.</li>
<li>Inside a sandbox, a user can tag the data by effecting changes to it.  Changes can be as simple as manual datum changes to as complex as running low pass or high pass filters. Each change (filter) adds its own tag.</li>
<li>Tagged data can be merged back into the main trunk.</li>
<li>QA and QC is the process of overseeing that changes made to the main trunk (merged) are valid.</li>
<li>QA and QC processes can be manual or automated.</li>
<li>Tags can be kept in the metadata</li>
<li>Changes deemed invalid can be rolled back because they are tagged.</li>
<li>A data HUB is part of VOEIS. It is comprised of the tools that parse input sensor data (real time or manual) and the software that houses the data itself (HIS or otherwise).</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
In this section we capture descriptions of the requirements that guided the development of 
VOEIS in plain english. These requirements were obtained from multiple sources, including 
interviews with stakeholders, technical documents, etc. Note that some of these requirements 
are very high level and multiple task decompositions are needed to refine and understand them better.
<h3>Stakeholder Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>GUI: Ability to see a map of a project</li>
<li>Ability to construct simple and complex queries to obtain earth science data at a given point in time and space</li>
<li>Ability to add information such as photos, links to other data, on-site physically collected data, monthly samples, etc. Basically, the ability to group data and to annotate individual datum or entire data sets with additional information that is not temporally or spatially located.</li>
<li>Support the generation of simple project activity and/or data reports</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development guidance from various documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scripting capabilities for QAQC
</li><li>Ability to organize data for efficient dissemination
</li><li>Interface for simulation models
</li><li>Web based secured access to sensors and high performance visualization and simulation engines
</li><li>APIs to tie into high performance computing
</li><li>Data paths to facilitate routing of data to publication gateway(s)
</li><li>Robust validation module for quality control. During QC, errors are corrected, data is annotated, and metadata is created
</li><li>A robust data provenance module
</li><li>A common format for storage and access via local, regional and global hubs. This is basically an interoperability requirement
</li><li>Develop or leverage existing software to facilitate the transfer of data from field sensor arrays, data loggers and analytical equipment into central data servers
</li><li>Develop or leverage software modules to allow access to data, manage data, provide authentication, etc. 
</li>
</ul>

<b>Significance:</b>
<br></br>
Researchers collect and analyze a wide variety of environmental data types, each with
unique formatting, preprocessing, and metadata requirements. This diversity often
creates a significant barrier to adoption of simple data management solutions. Effective 
data management is critical to the success of any research project and the 
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp" target="_blank"> National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> 
now requires funded researchers to implement data management plans. VOEIS fills 
this need, stadardizing data formatting and providing a breadth of data management features 
for storage, quality control, visualization, and publication for multiple
environmental data types. Intuitive and simple user interfaces greatly reduce the training time
required of researchers and lab group members for effective use of the
software. As an added bonus, users can integrate VOEIS into existing data-management workflows by 
utilizing the suite of available <a href="https://voeis.msu.montana.edu/doc/yard/Voeis/ApivsController.html" target="_blank">APIs.</a> 
These APIs also offer a convenient mechanism for using VOEIS with third-party scientific workflow 
software like <a href="https://kepler-project.org/" target="_blank">Kepler.</a>

<b>High Level Architecture</b>
<br></br>
VOEIS is implemented using the Yogo Framework with Ruby on Rails to take advantage of
the data management tools providing flexible schema management, RQL API, Role Based Access Controls (RBAC),
versioning, and support of multiple database back-ends making it platform independent. Currently the system uses
PostgreSQL as the backend storage system. Data processing has been optimized for PostgreSQL; however
generic implementations can make use of any DataMapper ORM supported backend such as MySQL, SQLite3,
Persevere, MongoDB, etc.

  <figcaption>VOEIS 2.0 Data Model</figcaption>
</figure>
<b>Data Model</b>
<br></br>The VOEIS data model is a relational data model loosely based on the 
<a href="http://his.cuahsi.org/odmdatabases.html" target="_blank"> 
CUAHSI HIS Observation Data Model (ODM)</a>. In fact, the original data model used in VOEIS 
was the ODM. However, as the number and diversity of users expanded in VOEIS, it became 
necessary to adjust the data model to accommodate a broader array of data types and use case 
needs. Many of these unique user needs were expressed in the structure of the 
<a href="documents/FDM.pdf" target="_blank">Field Data Model (FDM)</a>, a data model created 
by Geoffrey Poole and Clemente Izurieta at Montana State University. Thus began an effort to 
meld the utility and simplicity of the ODM with the more expansive functionality required by 
the FDM. The resulting data model should be familiar to users of the ODM, but boasts some unique 
characteristics that improve its extensibility to incorporate new data types and provide a mechanism 
for robust sample tracking, lab personnel tracking, and field sensor deployment tracking/management.
<ul>
<li><a href="documents/VOEIS_Tables.png" target="_blank">VOEIS 2.0 Data Model (Entity Relationship Diagram)</a></li>
</ul>
<b>Standards</b>
<br></br>
The importance of standard data formats during data publication is increasingly recognized. 
Self-describing data formats like Water Markup Language (WaterML), Ecological Metadata Languange (EML), 
and many others reduce errors in data interpretation by providing end-users with a recognizable data 
format that includes the minimum amount and type of metadata deemed necessary to described a set of 
data values. Data stored in VOEIS can be exported in .json or .xml formats. VOEIS users who want to publish data 
in WaterML format must first publish thier data set to HydroServer using the HIS Gateway. The VOEIS
development team is currently working on proof of concept features for direct exports of data stored in VOEIS 
using the WaterML and EML standards. 
<br></br>
<b>Controlled Vocabularies</b>
<br></br>
Semantic heterogeneity occurs when data generaters within a single scientific domain use differnet terms 
to descibe the same type of data. Adoption of recognized controlled vocabularies or domain ontologies 
eliminates the ambiguity this behavior ultimately produces. VOEIS uses the 
<a href="http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg.html" target="_blank">controlled vocabularies</a> developed 
by the CUAHSI HIS as the default setting for data projects. Users needing to alter these vocabularies 
to satisfy their specific domain requirements may adjust these vocabularies on a project-by-
project basis. This increases the number of use-cases and scientific domains where VOEIS is applicable. 
<br></br>
<b>Programming Interface</b>
<br></br>
The VOEIS Data Hub is designed to offer developers
programmatic access to data via RESTful APIs. The APIs
provide significant flexibility for users to create personalized
tools and views to interact with the data stored in
VOEIS. Access to API methods is role based and is
implemented using API keys that are linked to user accounts.
Thus, API access is managed in the same manner that regular
user access is handled. Further, the implementation of a
Resource Query Language (RQL) REST interface allows
dynamic data querying API functionality resembling SQL
database queries without the security risks and complication
inherent in exposing an SQL interface for a complex database
schema.

<b>HIS Gateway</b>
<img src="images/publication_gateway.png" style="margin: 2em; float: right; height: 180px;"></img>
<br></br>
A specific goal of the VOEIS project is to integrate with the CUAHSI HIS through HydroServer. 
In order for VOEIS to leverage the power of the CUAHSI HydroServer and its corresponding suite of 
tools, a fully functional REST interface that allows for the pulling and pushing of data objects 
was needed. We have constructed a HIS gateway using Ruby, Sinatra and the DataMapper ORM to provide 
the necessary REST functionality. Associated requirements for the HIS gateway include a simple 
authorization system to prevent malicious access, and the ability to serve up JSON and XML results 
from simple URL style queries that can behave like full APIs to the ODM data-store. The initial 
implementation of the VOEIS HIS gateway is currently available for use as a standalone JRuby server 
application that can be deployed on any platform.
